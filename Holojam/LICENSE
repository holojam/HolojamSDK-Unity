Holojam Inc. ("Holojam") is providing you the enclosed version of the Holojam Relay application (the "Relay"), and the Holojam software development kit (the "SDK") to enable and facilitate your creation and development of group virtual-reality software applications. The SDK can be downloaded at https://github.com/holojamvr/HolojamSDK-Unity/releases, to the extent that it is made available to you for download.

The Relay, SDK and other software products (collectively, "Product(s)") are licensed, not sold, to you. Holojam shall have sole discretion to determine and/or modify the availability, nature, features, content, versioning of the Relay and SDK that it makes available to you for download.

Your license to each Product that you obtain is subject to your prior acceptance of this Holojam Developer Software End User License Agreement ("EULA"), and you agree that the terms of this EULA will apply to each Product that you license, unless that Product is covered by a valid end user license agreement between you and Holojam or the Application Provider of that Product, in which case the terms of that separate end user license agreement will govern. Your license to any Holojam Product under this EULA or separate end user license agreement is granted by Holojam, and your license to any third-party Product under this EULA or separate end user license agreement is granted by the application provider of that third-party Product. Any Product that is subject to the license granted under this EULA is referred to herein as the "Product". The application provider or Holojam as applicable ("Licensor") reserves all rights in and to the Product not expressly granted to you under this EULA.

A. Terms and Conditions; Scope of License; Limitations. Holojam grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited right and license to use the Products solely in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. All rights not specifically granted herein are reserved by Holojam and, as applicable, Holojam’s licensors. This license confers no title or ownership in the Products and should not be construed as an offer of sale or sale of any rights therein. You agree not to: (a) sell, rent, lease, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Products without the express prior written consent of Holojam; (b) reverse engineer, derive source code from, modify source code from, or decompile source code from the Product in whole or in part, or (c) make any commercial use of the Product without the prior written consent of Holojam. Holojam will have no obligation to provide any updates or upgrades to the Products, but in the event that it does, such updates, upgrades and any documentation will only be deemed part of the Product once made available to the public, and will be subject to these Terms and Conditions and this EULA.

B. Ownership. As between you and Holojam, Holojam will own all right, title, and interest in and to the Products and any and all modifications, copies, or derivatives thereof or improvements thereto. You hereby assign any and all right, title and interest to any intellectual property rights, including trademark, patent, and copyright rights, in any modifications, derivatives, or improvements to the Products you create. You must maintain any proprietary notices and attributions in any such derivatives, modifications or improvements to the Products that you create. For avoidance of doubt, Holojam and its assignees and licensees will be free to use such modifications, derivatives, or improvements without approval from you and without compensation or attribution to you, and you agree to provide source code and binary code to Holojam upon request for any such modifications, derivatives, or improvements. You will have only the limited license to use the Products in accordance with these Terms & Conditions and EULA.

E. Termination. The license is effective until terminated by you or Licensor. Your rights under this license will terminate automatically without notice from the Licensor if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this license.

F. External Service; Third-Party Materials. The Product may enable access to Licensor's and/or third-party services and websites (collectively and individually, "External Service"). Use of the External Service requires Internet access and use of certain External Service requires you to accept additional terms.

You understand that by using any of the External Service, you may encounter content that may be deemed offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the External Service at your sole risk and that neither the Licensor nor its agents will have any liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.

Certain External Service may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or materials from third parties ("Third Party Materials") or provide links to certain third party websites.

Neither the Licensor nor its agents warrant or endorse and do not assume and will not have any liability or responsibility to you or any other person for any third-party services, Third Party Materials or websites, or for any other materials, products, or services of third parties. Third Party Materials and links to other websites are provided solely as a convenience to you.

You agree that the External Service contains proprietary content, information and material that is owned by Licensor and/or its agents or licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not limited to copyright, and that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials in any way whatsoever, except as permitted by the External Service, and not in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this EULA or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or Holojam. No portion of the External Service may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the External Service, in any manner, and you will not exploit the External Service in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the External Service to transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening network capacity. You further agree not to use the External Service in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that neither Licensor nor its agents are in any way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive, infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the External Service.

In addition, External Service and Third Party Materials are not available in all languages or in all countries or regions. Licensor makes no representation that such External Service and Materials are appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access such External Service and Third Party Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws. Licensor reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any External Service at any time without notice.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PRODUCT AND ANY SERVICE PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY THE PRODUCT ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE", WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCT AND ANY SERVICE, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

I. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PRODUCT, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES (OTHER THAN AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN CASES INVOLVING PERSONAL INJURY) EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF FIFTY DOLLARS ($50.00). THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE STATED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
